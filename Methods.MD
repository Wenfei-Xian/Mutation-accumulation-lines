1, Genome assembly
   Hifi reads were generated by Deepconsensus.
   Hifiasm was used to assemble the genome.
   
2, Genome polish
   Self-hifi reads were mapped to self-assembly using minimap2, sequence depth was conduct by mosdepth, and deepvariant was used to call the variants. 
   Using retain_homozygous.py, homozygous variants with REF Allele depth <= 3, total depth within 0.5 to 2 times the sequencing depth, and biallelic were retained.
